       There’s a sort of certain swirling anxiety lurking beneath the surface here, in the dimly lit corners of the room that are visible but still hard to make out sometimes. Maybe it's the time of day—the magic hour between the evening and night when the illumination becomes beautiful and flat at the same time, removing the perceptible contrast of our spaces. Maybe this anxiety fits in that corner where what comes next isn’t quite so certain, if ascertainable at all. An anxiety about time, things out of our control, and surrendering to that as a way to release ourselves and become free, for once, in the middle of all of this fucked up world we all reside in. <br><br>

      The guitar that opens the song sounds like afternoon light in the Fall, something bright and glowing, something you know is going to leave soon, but its presence is welcome, however brief. It’s a sort of composition of guitar noodling, without vocals, except for a few vocal samples sort spiking over or weaving around the main riff, as if to say “I recognize what’s going on too.” Ethereal, bubbling with the keyboards.<br><br>

      We move to a clearance — visibility again and two keyboard notes — clear as it can be. Right into the drums. Here we go.<br><br>

      Now the voice becomes the instrument. The flow of lyrics, rapping over the beats, swirling with samples sliding in and out. It’s like breathing, really. Reminiscent when we arrive at “I cannot breathe”, and continue to breathe together through the lyrics as they go forward in rhythmic inhales, exhales. Attacking everything around the now—the anxiety about the places (LA, “Stay in my room, haunted by news”), the ideas (Utopia broke), etc.<br><br> 

      The outro, slippage again. Samples breaking in and out like radio static, signals colliding in the air. The refrain asking the listening and ourselves in as almost as mellow fashion as possible asking us to confront something: what are we really afraid of? Maybe it's nothing after all? Maybe it's fear itself? Maybe it's being alone? Maybe asking each other this is the only answer we really need?</p><br><br>

      <p class="excerpt">“Ain't nowhere for me to run-run-run-run-r-<br>
      Are you scared? Are you scared again?<br>
      Are you scared again?”</p><br><br>
    
    <p>
      In a way, this song, similar to the adolescent song, there’s a certain earnest nature about looking towards the future, being uncertain about what that future holds, and acceptance of that very feeling. Maybe this is the sound of the world falling off the edge and the exact slippage of that moment. The moment when everything is uncertain and physics becomes undone or suspended but when the exact possibility of everything becomes endless and open all at once. The title of the album “Vergangenheitsbewältigung (Crater Speak)” references the German term meaning to "struggle to overcome the [negatives of the] past" or “working through the past” which Wikipedia elaborates is “describing processes that since the late 20th century have become key in the study of post-1945 German literature, society, and culture.” This overlap of working through the past to arrive at the future seems not so coincidental. It is the struggle of living a life worth living, bringing all that you do with you, and whatever leaves its trace with you.<br><br>
